How do you troubleshoot a site that just returns a blank white screen?

I would look at url to see if the url is correct, then open up the developer console to check for errors. Then I'll look at
the network tab to see if resources are not being loaded properly. If I work with react, I would look at fallback error.

What is CSS Box Model?

Box model is a rectangle box that wraps around every html element. includes margin, border, and padding

What happens when you type in URL?

ex: https://jennapederson.dev/hello-world

https: establish secure connection over TLS (encryption protocol)
jennapederson.dev is the domain name, points to specific server's ip address
hello-world is the path on the server to the particular resource.

Browser looks up IP address for domain using DNS. Goes through many layers of cache. Once the browser gets the DNS record with the IP address,
itâ€™s time for it to find the server on the Internet and establish a connection.

Using CDN (global cache server network), static/dynamic content gets cached closer to browser. Browser starts TCP connection with server

Browser starts HTTP request (headers, metadata, and body), server sends back response in http form.
