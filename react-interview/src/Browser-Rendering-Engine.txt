How does the Browser Rendering Engine work?

1. Document Object Model(DOM)
2. CSS object model(CSSOM)
3. Render Tree
4. Layout
5. Paint.

DOM
  1. Convert bytes to characters
  2. Identify tokens
  3. Convert tokens to nodes
  4. Build DOM Tree

CSSOM (brower blocks the page from continuing to render until this is finished)
  1. Convert bytes to characters
  2. Identify tokens
  3. Convert tokens to nodes
  4. Build CSSOM

Render Tree Finishes (browser combines DOM and CSSOM into one render tree)

Layout (browser has to calculate the position and sizes of each visible element on the page)

Paint (browser picks up the layout result and paints the pixels to the screen)

Typically, execution of javascript scripts blocks the rendering path, with two exceptions, 
1. Inlined scripts above the css files ‘<link>’ in the ‘<head>’;
2. Async scripts.

Optimizing: 
  minifying and compressing html and css (obfuscation: )
  inline css only for header and main module, then async css for rest of page
  webfonts must be async in this case
