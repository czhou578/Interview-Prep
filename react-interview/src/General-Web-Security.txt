Service Workers: script that browser runs in the background separate from web page. It has for example, push notification capability, 
and background sync. Uses promises, and is using JS, so cannot access DOM, can allow you to control how network requests are handled. 


Headers:
  cache-control: contains instructions in both request and responses that control caching in browsers

  Etag: identifier for a specific version of a resource (ie. ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4")
    - If a resource is updated, then a new Etag must be generated to help ensure whether representations of data are the same

  Transfer-encoding: specifies form of encoding to safely transfer payload body to the user
    - applied to a message between 2 nodes (hop by hop)
    - (ie. gzip, compressed, chunk...)

Performance:

  Critical-Rendering-Path: time after receiving HTML, CSS, JS and the processing turning them into rendered pixels
    - 


  Preload / Preconnect / Prefetch

  preload in link rel tag, specifies resources that your page needs very soon and want to start loading in page lifecycle
  preconnect: resolves DNS and TCP handshaking
  Prefetch: fetches resource and places it in cache for faster retrieval instead of making another full request
