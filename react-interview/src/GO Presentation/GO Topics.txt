Go modules



Go vs Javascript
 - Go has two type of functions, normal and interface functions. 
 - Normal functions do not have a global this and are similar to js arrow functions, while interface functions do have
  a this and thus are similar to regular js functions.
 - Go functions can return multiple values, which is not possible in JS under conventional circumstances.

 - variables in same scope cannot be redeclared in GO (var in go is similar to let in js)
 - no while keyword in Go, when declaring while loops, use for. 
 - go spread operator only works in interface arrays or slices.
 - go is static typed vs js's dynamic typing, so go is faster in performance terms
 - no ternary operator in Go
 - In switch statements, GO defaults to break after each clause, JS defaults to fall through. Fall through keyword in GO
 - GO functions cannot hold extra attributes.
